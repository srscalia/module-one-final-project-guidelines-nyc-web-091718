# NYC Public High Schools Analysis (2018)

The mayor of NYC (or any curious citizen) wants to learn more about New York City public high schools. The app leverages the [NYC OpenData: 2018 DOE High School Directory](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2018-DOE-High-School-Directory/vw9i-7mzq) to pull data on each school. The NYC Public High Schools Analysis has five models: Borough, Mayor, School, Subway Stop, and School-Subway-Stop. The objective of the analysis is to summarize borough and school data.
